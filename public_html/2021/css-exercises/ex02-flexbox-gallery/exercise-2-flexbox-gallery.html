    <h1>Exercise 2</h1>
    <p>This is Exercise #2, lecture on CSS Flexbox, used in the course
        <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2301">IDATA2301 Web technologies</a>
        at NTNU, campus Aalesund.
    </p>
    <p>Go <a href="../../index.html">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the exercise is to practice configuring container properties for CSS flexbox.
        You may need to set some properties for the images, but no flexbox-related item properties.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Use this document as a template. You see a set of images below. Configure the following
        behaviour for the flexbox container:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The images should be in a flexbox container.</li>
        <li>Each image should be 200px wide and 150px high.</li>
        <li>The container should fill the whole width of the page, with 50px margins on the sides.
        </li>
        <li>The container should not shrink to less than 500px horizontally
            (hint: <code>min-width</code> property).
        </li>
        <li>The container should be 800px high.</li>
        <li>The images should be laid out horizontally and have equal spacing between them
            and on the sides.
        </li>
        <li>If there is not enough space to lay out the images in a single row, the gallery
            should have an "automatic wrapping" - the images should be wrapped to a new line.
        </li>
        <li>The images should be centered vertically within the container. Add some border to the
            container to see that they are centered.
        </li>
        <li>The images should have a minimum margin of 20px. I.e., there could be more space between
            each two the images, but no less than 2*20px.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The following CSS properties may be handy (for the container):</p>
    <pre><code>
        display: flex;
        justify-content
        align-content
        flex-wrap
    </code></pre>

    <p>Here you can see a an example of how the gallery could look on a wide screen:</p>
    <img src="img/gallery-preview01.jpg" alt="Five images laid out on a single row"/>
    <p>And this is how it could look on a narrow screen:</p>
    <img src="img/gallery-preview02.jpg"
         alt="Five images laid out on three rows: two, two and one on each row"/>

    <h2>Extra challenge</h2>
    <p>If you are done with the exercise too fast and are bored, you can practice CSS:
        add some fancy effects, such as shadows, hover effects,
        <a href="https://thinkux.ca/blog/Creating-Framed-Matted-Pictures-Using-CSS/">a picture
            frame</a>,
        or even a <a href="https://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/PbBwjp">very fancy frame</a>.
    </p>


    <h2>Template</h2>
    <p>Start with this file as a template. It should be enough by creating only the CSS style,
        the HTML elements are in place already.</p>
    <h3>The gallery</h3>
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=1" alt="Random picture">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=2" alt="Random picture">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=3" alt="Random picture">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=4" alt="Random picture">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=5" alt="Random picture">

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>You can find a solution in <a href="../solutions/ex02-solution.html">
        <code>../solutions/ex02-solution.html</code></a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Side note(s)</h2>
    <p>You can find nice random pictures at <a href="https://picsum.photos/">Lorem Picsum</a>.
    <p>The images in the gallery were created using the following Emmet shortcut:
        <code>img[src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=$"][alt="Random picture"]*5</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The <code>?random_index=...</code> was added to make sure that the URLs for images are
        unique. Otherwise the browser would decide that it is five equal images and display the same
        image in all five places. A nice "hack" that may be handy sometimes to avoid file caching -
        add something random to the URL, for example, the timestamp. :)
