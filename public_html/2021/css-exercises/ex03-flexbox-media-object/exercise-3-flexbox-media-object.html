    <h1>Exercise 3</h1>
    <p>This is Exercise #3, lecture on CSS Flexbox, used in the course
        <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2301">IDATA2301 Web technologies</a>
        at NTNU, campus Aalesund.

    <p>Go <a href="../../index.html">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the exercise is to practice configuring flexbox, including item properties.
        There is a popular pattern in web development, called "media pattern". The idea is to
        display an image and text side by side, without wrapping the text around the image.
        An example could be a comment on a blog article.
        In this exercise you will create a flexible container for displaying the media object and a
        text.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Create an HTML document with an image and a text or reasonable length (how about Emmet
        expression <code>lipsum800</code> ?). You can use images from
        <a href="https://picsum.photos/">Lorem Picsum</a>.
        Align them as in the media object pattern:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Image on the left, text on the right.</li>
        <li>Image should fill 30% of the available width, the text: 70%.</li>
        <li>Minimum width for the image: 150px. Minimum width for the text column: 350px.</li>
        <li>Both image and text containers should dynamically expand if there is more space
            available.
        </li>
        <li>Image should have correct proportions.</li>
        <li>The image should have 20px margin on the sides (not on the top).</li>
        <li>If there is not enough horizontal space available, a scrollbar should appear. I.e., the
            text should not wrap under the image.
        </li>
        <li>Now try to align the image on the right. If you have done it correctly, it should be a
            single additional line of CSS code.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The following CSS properties may be handy (for the container):</p>
    <pre><code>
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap
        flex-basis
        flex-grow
        flex-shrink
        align-self
        order
        min-width
        margin
    </code></pre>

    <p>Here you can see a an example of how it could look:</p>
    <img src="img/media-object-example.jpg"
         alt="An image with a woman on the left and a text paragraph on the right"/>
    <p>And this is how it could look when you move the image to the right:</p>
    <img src="img/media-object-example2.jpg"
         alt="An image with a woman on the right and a text paragraph on the left"/>

    <h2>Extra challenge</h2>
    <p>Try nesting the image and text. It should work "out of the box". This could be useful in
        blogs with commenting feature. P.S. There could be some issues with the min-width though.
    </p>


    <h2>Template</h2>
