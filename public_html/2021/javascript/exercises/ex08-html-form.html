    <section>
        <h3>Part 1 - a "login" form</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a document with an HTML form.</li>
            <li>Set the forms method to <code>POST</code> and target (the URL of the receiving script) to
                <code>https://web-tek.ninja/php_backend/dummy_login.php</code>.
            </li>
            <li>Add the following input fields in it:
                <ol>
                    <li>A text input with name <code>username</code> and default value "john".</li>
                    <li>A password input with name <code>key</code>.</li>
                    <li>Add labels for the inputs</li>
                    <li>Add a hidden field with a name and value of your choice.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Add a "Submit form" button.</li>
            <li>Try to post the form. You should get an HTML page in response (generated by a dynamic PHP script on the
                server). Check out what the page is saying and find what you need to enter in the <code>key</code>
                field to get a "total success" :).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part 2 - extra challenge</h3>
        <p>This part requires a bit of <i>hacking</i> - exploration of an existing website. The task is to create an
            external search field for <a href="https://jula.no">jula.no</a>.</p>
        <p>Create your own website with a text input field and a submit button. Make the title of the button
            "Det er Jula snart!". When the user presses the button, she should be redirected to Jula.no webpage and
            should see search results for the item that was entered in the text input.
