    <p>Go <a href="../../index.html">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the exercise is learn how you can remove elements from the DOM and add new
        ones.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>Part 1 - add a paragraph on button-click</h3>
        <p>Create a document with a button. Create Javascript which adds a &lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
            to the document every time the user presses the button.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Part 2 - add a table row</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Extend the previous example: create a table with two columns. Add one row in it,
                with any content you want. Add a button. Every time the user clicks
                on the button, add a new row to the table with text "Hello" in one column and
                "World" in the other column. Hint: <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
                has <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> as
                the direct child, rows should be added to the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> element not
                to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> directly!
            </li>
            <li>
                Extend the previous example: add a button "Remove last row". When the user clicks on
                it, the last row of the table is removed. If the table has only one row left, an
                alert
                is shown saying "Can't remove the last row", and the row is not removed.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Part 3 - div inside a box</h3>
        <p>
            Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to the page, set it's height and width to
            100px, background color to green. Make the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element escape -
            when the user moves the mouse over it,
            the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is removed from the place it currently
            <i>sits</i>
            and is moved to a random place in the table above. I.e, it is added to a random
            row and random column inside the table you created in the previous steps.

        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Part 4 - div outside the box</h3>
        <p>Extra challenge: add some more content to the page (some headings, paragraphs,
            etc) and make the div escape randomly at any place in the DOM tree. I.e., don't
            limit it's placement to the table.
        </p>
