<p>Here we show that Javascript engine is single-threaded.</p>
<p>When you press on Button A, it will consume the processor for some time and then add a paragraph to the DOM. When you
    press on Button B, it will immediately add a paragraph to the DOM. To see that the JS engine is single-threaded, try
    to press button A, and shortly after press button B a couple of times. You should see that nothing happens for a
    while, and after that your button B clicks are processed. This shows the behaviour of event queue in Javascript -
    the browser is multi-threaded and can capture user events, but it places it to JS engine event queue, and the
    single-threaded JS engine processes those events one after another.</p>
