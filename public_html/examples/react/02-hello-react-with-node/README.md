# Hello React with Node!

This is a React JS project, generated using with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
(and cleaned afterwards, to leave a minimalistic example).

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
