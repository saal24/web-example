# Context example

A React project showing how we can use a global Context to hold data used across different components in the component
tree. We can avoid the _prop drilling_ - passing props down to children, children of children, etc.

In this example we hold products in the context and pass them down the component hierarchy.

See the [next example](../08-nested-context-update) on how nested components can initiate updates to the context.

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
