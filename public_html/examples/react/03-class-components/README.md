# React class component example

A React project with class components. Idea and some code
from [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview).

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

# Logic

Try clicking on the cells in the grid.

# Concepts

We show the use of props and state here:

* Props are passed from the parent to the child components
* State is maintained inside each component
