# React JWT authentication example

A React project showing how to implement JWT authentication in React. The functionality for this project is equal
to the plain-Javascript frontend part
of [JWT authentication example](https://github.com/strazdinsg/app-dev/tree/main/security-demos/07-backend-frontend-jwt-auth)
.

Note: we store all data in the top App-component and use prop drilling here. In real projects we would use Redux. We
don't use Redux here just to keep the example minimalistic.

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
