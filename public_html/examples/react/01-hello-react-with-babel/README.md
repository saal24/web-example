# Hello, React with Babel (without Node)

This example shows how we can develop applications with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework without using Node.js.
JSX needs translation, but that can be done in real-time using [Babel JS](https://babeljs.io/). In practice, however, no
serious projects use
it - too slow and inefficient. This is a theoretical example just to show how JSX _can_ be translated to Javascript with
Babel.
