# REST API request example

A React project showing how to send a REST request to a backend API and how to load data into React UI.

Note: in "real" projects you would store the data in either Redux store or global context, here we simplify it to get a
minimalistic example.

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
