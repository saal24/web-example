<p>Here we include some random images.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?param=1" alt="Unknown content">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?param=2" alt="Unknown content">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?param=3" alt="Unknown content">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?param=4" alt="Unknown content">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?param=5" alt="Unknown content">
</p>

<p>Warning - if you include whitespace characters (space, newline) between
    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and other elements (text or other images), the
    browser will insert a space around the image! If you don't want that, make
    sure the image tag does not have space around it! Like this:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/100?param=1" alt="Unknown content"><img
        src="https://picsum.photos/200/100?param=2" alt="Unknown content"><img
        src="https://picsum.photos/200/100?param=3" alt="Unknown content"><img
        src="https://picsum.photos/200/100?param=4" alt="Unknown content"><img
        src="https://picsum.photos/200/100?param=5" alt="Unknown content">
</p>
<p>There will still be vertical space by default, as the images are considered
    part of a text paragraph.</p>
