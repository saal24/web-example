<h1>Resetting REM</h1>
<p>In this example we reset rem to 10px. This is a typical technique for web
    developers - makes the usage of rem units easier. How do we do that? We
    redefine the font size for <code>html</code> tag. Because that is rem by
    definition: 1 rem = font size of <code>html</code> element.
    Check out the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> section in this document!</p>
<p>After this manipulation, text becomes tiny. But we can easily fix that by
    setting <code>font-size</code> to necessary elements.</p>
