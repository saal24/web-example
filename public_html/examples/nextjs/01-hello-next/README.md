# Hello, Next.js!

This is a minimalistic Next.JS example. It was created
using `npx create-next-app@latest` and then stripping away the unnecessary
stuff.

You can run the app in debug mode with `npm run dev`.

If you want to get a production-version, run `npm run build` first, then you can
deploy the project with `npm run start`.
