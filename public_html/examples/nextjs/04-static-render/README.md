# Static page rendering

This example shows how to pre-render the pages with data fetching. Data is
fetched from the file system, then provided to the `Home` component
with `getStaticProps()`.

You can run the app in debug mode with `npm run dev`.

If you want to get a production-version, run `npm run build` first, then you can
deploy the project with `npm run start`.
