    <h1>Import example</h1>
    <p>
      This example demonstrates how we can use the <code>import</code> in the
      frontend Javascript. Import is widely used when working with external
      modules together with build tools such as Node Package Manager (npm). Not
      that often used in the manner shown here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frontend use of import (as shown here) is a relatively new feature, but
      the global support for it is more than 92% (last checked: March 2022).
    </p>
    <p>To see how the import works, see source of <code>main.js</code></p>
