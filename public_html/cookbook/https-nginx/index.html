    <h1>HTTPS Setup for Nginx web server</h1>
    <p>
      This is a short step-by-step <i>recipe</i> for setup of secure HTTPS
      connections for Nginx web server, using the free
      <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">"Let's Encrypt"</a> service. This
      recipe is used in courses

    <p>
      This recipe is based on the guide
      <a
        href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/"
      >
        "Using Free Letâ€™s Encrypt SSL/TLS Certificates with NGINX"</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before you begin - you should get a domain name for your server. This step
      is optional, but recommended. Alternatively, you can use HTTPS for an IP
      address, but that is not conventional. Domain registration is not
      described here.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Log into your server using SSH</li>
      <li>
        Install Certbot command-line tool, provided by Let's Encrypt. To do
        that, run the following commands:
        <pre>
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Let Nginx know which domain you are using - edit the config file:
        <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default</code>. There you
        specify line <code>server_name yourDomain;</code> For example, if the
        domain is <code>example.com</code>, then the file looks as follows:
        <img
          alt="Nginx configuration file with server name marked"
          src="01-nginx-server-name.png"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Restart the Nginx web server:
        <code>sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Run CertBot to obtain certificate for your domain (replace
        <code>example.com</code> with your domain!)
        <pre>sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Answer the questions asked. Suggested: redirect all traffic to HTTPS.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you take a look in the config file, you see that Certbot has added
        the necessary config lines. It has also saved the <code>.pem</code> file
        with the certificate, including the private key. Keep it secret! See the
        lines added by Certbot marked in the picture below.
        <img
          alt="Nginx config file with some lines added by Certbot"
          src="02-certbot-additions.png"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        To set up automatic certificate renewal, add the following line to cron
        tasks (command to edit cron tasks: <code>sudo crontab -e</code>):
        <pre>0 12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
