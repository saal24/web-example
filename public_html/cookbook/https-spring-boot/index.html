    <h1>HTTPS Setup for Spring Boot</h1>
    <p>
      This is a short step-by-step <i>recipe</i> for setup of secure HTTPS
      connections for Spring Boot server applications (REST API). This recipe is
      used in courses

      This recipe is based on the guide
      <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-secured-by-lets-encrypt">
        "Spring Boot Secured By Let's Encrypt"</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here we assume that you have a .pem file containing the TLS certificate
      with your private key. See recipe on
      <a href="../https-nginx">HTTPS for Nginx</a> on how to generate it.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the terminal as a root. If you have logged in as a non-root user,
        become root by using command <code>sudo su</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Convert the Certbot-generated key to PKCS12 format. Certbot saved your
        key in directory <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain</code>. For
        example, if your domain is <code>example.com</code>, the key is saved in
        directory <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com</code>. Go to that
        directory: <code>cd /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com</code>. Then
        Convert the key:
        <pre>
openssl pkcs12 -export -in fullchain.pem -inkey privkey.pem -out keystore.p12 -name tomcat -CAfile chain.pem -caname root</pre
        >
        You can protect the key with a password, but using no password is OK as
        well. If everything went well, now you have a file
        <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/keystore.p12</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Copy the <code>keystore.p12</code> to project files:
        <code>src/main/resources</code> - the same directory where the
        <code>application.properties</code> is
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the permissions for the file so that the non-root user can read
        it: <code>sudo chmod a+r src/main/resources/keystore.p12</code> Note:
        this will make the key file (including the private key) readable for ALL
        users on your server. If this is not what you need, you can make it
        readable only to your user. For example, if the username of your user is
        `dev`, then you can make `dev` the owner of the key with this command:
        <code>sudo chown dev:root src/main/resources/keystore.p12</code> The
        important thing is that the key file is readable for the user which will
        run the Spring Boot application.
      </li>
      <li>
        Configure your Spring Boot app to use HTTPS, and only HTTPS. Add the
        following lines to your <code>application.properties</code> (Remember to
        replace <code>example.com</code> with your domain!):
        <pre>
server.port=8443
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=your-password (if you don't use password for the key, still need this line, just without a value)
server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12
server.ssl.keyAlias=tomcat</pre
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Package the application in a <em>fat JAR</em> with the command
        <code>mvn package</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can run the application by running
        <code>java -jar target/*.jar</code>
      </li>
    </ol>
