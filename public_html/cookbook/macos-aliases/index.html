    <h1>MAC OS aliases</h1>
    <p>
      Are you using a Mac? Tired of typing long commands with many parameters
      again and again? Well, you can define <em>aliases</em>.

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You need to know the command you will want to make a shortcut (alias)
        for. For example, you may log into your server using SSH with the
        following command:
        <pre>ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-secret-key.pem ubuntu@my-server-ip</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        The aliases are defined in the file <code>~/.zshrc</code>. You need to
        edit that file and put your aliases there. To edit the file, run the
        following command in the terminal:
        <pre>nano ~/.zshrc</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Each alias in that file is defined as a line in the following format:
        <pre>alias youraliasname='the code you want to execute'</pre>
        For example, if you want to make a shortcut named
        <code>ssh-into-server</code> which will execute the command
        <code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-secret-key.pem ubuntu@my-server-ip</code>, then
        you add the following line to the file:
        <pre>
alias ssh-into-server='ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-secret-key.pem ubuntu@my-server-ip'</pre
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Save the file and exit the editor: press <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd>, then
        <kbd>Y</kbd>, then <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close all terminal windows (to force import of the aliases next time you
        open a new terminal window).
      </li>
    </ol>

        >That's all, Folks!</a
      >
      From now on you can use the <code>ssh-into-server</code> command instead
      of the long command with all the parameters.
