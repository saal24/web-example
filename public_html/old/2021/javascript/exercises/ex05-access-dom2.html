      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is learn how you can select more than one
        element and traverse the children.
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h3>Part 1 - inspect an existing site in the console</h3>

      <p>
        Go to <a href="https://web-tek.ninja">https://web-tek.ninja</a> in your
        browser (preferably in another tab), open developer tool console and
        explore the DOM:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Select all elements with class <code>css-exercise</code>. You should
          get all 6 <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
          elements containing links to CSS exercises. But you probably got only
          5 items, right. Can you find what is missing? P.S. Debugging and
          finding mistakes in HTML, CSS and Javascript is an essential skill!
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the first <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element on the page,
          store it in a variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now use that variable to find all <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> elements
          inside that article. How many did you get? What do they refer to?
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Part 2 - Create your own page</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create an HTML document with a 3x3 grid container. An opportunity to
          remember how CSS grids work ;).
        </li>
        <li>Put 9 div elements inside it.</li>
        <li>
          For even div elements add <code>class="even"</code> (div number 2, 4,
          …, 8), for odd elements (div number 1, 3, …, 9) add
          <code>class="odd"</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a Javascript code (execute it when the page is loaded) which
          sets text to "X" for all odd elements (those with
          <code>class="odd"</code>) and sets text to "O" for all elements with
          <code>class="even"</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Extra challenge: find out how you can do the same even if you don't
          assign any classes to the nine divs. (Find out how can you access odd
          and even child elements separately in Javascript)
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        You can find a solution for the second part in
        <a href="../solutions/ex05-solution.html"
          ><code>../solutions/ex05-solution.html</code></a
        >.
