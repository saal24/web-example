    <h1>Exercise 6</h1>
    <p>This is Exercise #6, lecture on modifying DOM with Javascript, used in the course

        at NTNU, campus Aalesund.

    <p>Go <a href="../../index.html">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the exercise is learn how you can access and modify some properties of DOM
        elements.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>Part 1 - add/remove class</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a page with one paragraph of text.</li>
            <li>Add a CSS block which sets a yellow background and font to "Courier New" for all
                items with class "yellow".
            </li>
            <li>Add two buttons A and B to the page.</li>
            <li>Button A should have a text "Add". When user clicks on it, class "yellow" is added
                to the
                text paragraph (and hence it should get a yellow background).
            </li>
            <li>Button B should have a text "Remove". A click on it removes the "yellow" class from
                the
                paragraph.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Part 2 - color picker</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Find out, how you can <i>catch</i> the event of user picking a value in selectbox,
                and how you can read the value.
            </li>
            <li>Create a page with a text "Pick your favorite color", and a selectbox with values
                ["Red", "Green" "Roundhouse kick"].
            <li>Add a text which says: "I see that your favorite color is …". Hint it is probably a
                good idea to create a paragraph for the whole sentence and include a span for the
                placeholder of the color. Something along these lines:
                <code>&lt;p&gt;I see that your favorite color is&lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>.
                You probably also want an ID for the span to get a reference to it in Javascript.
            </li>
            <li>Add Javascript which reacts on user picking a color and
                replaces the "…" with the name of the chosen color.
            </li>
            <li>Extend the solution of the previous exercise, add some more colors to the
                selectbox.
            </li>
            <li>Add a div of a certain size (for example, 220x150 pixels), set
                <code>id="color-example"</code> for it.
            </li>
            <li>Whenever the user picks a color in the selectbox, set the
                background color of that div to the chosen color. Hint: you probably want to define
                color codes (such as <code>#ff0000</code>) as values for the selecbox options, in
                addition to the values displayed for the user. An example:
                <code>&lt;option value="#ff0000"&gt;Red&lt;/option&gt;</code>. You will also need to
                modify the code displaying the user-friendly value of the color. Find out on the net
                how you can access the index of selected item for a selectbox, and then text of the
                selected option.
            </li>
            <li>Extra challenge: when "Roundhouse kick" is
                selected, set background image of the div with id="example" to a picture of
                <i>you know whom.</i>
            </li>
        </ol>
