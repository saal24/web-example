    <h1>Exercise 10.11</h1>
    <p>This is Exercise 10.11, lecture on modifying DOM with Javascript, used in the course
        <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2301">IDATA2301 Web technologies</a>
        at NTNU, campus Aalesund.

    <p>Go <a href="../../index.html">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the exercise is to learn how you can remove elements from the DOM and add new ones. </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>Part 1 - Add/remove a table row</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a document and add a table with two columns.</li>
            <li>Add three rows in it, with any content you want.</li>
            <li>Add a button with text "Add a row".</li>
            <li>Every time the user clicks on the button, add a new row to the table with text "Hello" in one column and
                "World" in the other column. Hint: <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>
                has <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> as the direct child, rows should be added to the
                <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> element not
                to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> directly!
            </li>
            <li>
                Extend the previous example: add a button "Remove last row". When the user clicks on it, the last row of
                the table is removed.
            </li>
            <li> If the table has only three rows left, an alert is shown saying "Can't remove the last 3 rows", and the
                row is not removed.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Part 2 - div inside a box</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to the page, set its height and width to
                <code>20px</code>, background color to <code>green</code>.
            </li>
            <li>Make the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element escape - when the user moves the mouse over it,
                the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is removed from the place it currently
                <i>sits</i> and is moved to a random place in the table above. I.e, it is added to a random
                row and random column inside the table you created in the previous steps.

        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Part 3 - div outside the box</h3>
        <p>Extra challenge: add some more content to the page (some headings, paragraphs,
            etc.) and make the div escape randomly at any place in the DOM tree. I.e., don't
            limit its placement to the table.
        </p>
