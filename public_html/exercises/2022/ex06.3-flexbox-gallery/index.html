    <h1>Exercise 6.3</h1>
    <p>This is Exercise #6.3, lecture on CSS Flexbox, used in the course
        <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2301">IDATA2301 Web
            technologies</a> at NTNU, campus Aalesund.
    </p>
    <p>Go <a href="../..">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the exercise is to practice configuring container
        properties for CSS flexbox. You may need to set some properties for the
        images, but no <code>flexbox-item</code> properties.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Use this document as a template. You see a set of images below. Configure
        the following behaviour for the flexbox container:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The images should be in a flexbox container.</li>
        <li>Each image should be 200px wide and 150px high.</li>
        <li>The container should fill the whole width of the page, with 50px
            margins on the sides.
        </li>
        <li>The container should not shrink to less than 500px horizontally
            (hint: <code>min-width</code> property).
        </li>
        <li>The container should be 800px high.</li>
        <li>The images should be laid out horizontally and have equal spacing
            between them
            and on the sides.
        </li>
        <li>If there is not enough space to lay out the images in a single row,
            the gallery
            should have an "automatic wrapping" - the images should be wrapped
            to a new line.
        </li>
        <li>The images should be centered vertically within the container. Add
            some border to the
            container to see that they are centered.
        </li>
        <li>The images should have a minimum margin of 20px. I.e., there could
            be more space between
            each two the images, but no less than 2*20px.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The following CSS properties may be handy (for the container):</p>
    <pre><code>
        display: flex;
        justify-content
        align-content
        flex-wrap
    </code></pre>

    <p>Here you can see an example of how the gallery could look on a wide
        screen:</p>
    <img src="img/gallery-preview01.jpg"
         alt="Five images laid out on a single row"/>
    <p>And this is how it could look on a narrow screen:</p>
    <img src="img/gallery-preview02.jpg"
         alt="Five images laid out on three rows: two, two and one on each row"/>

    <h2>Extra challenge</h2>
    <p>If you are done with the exercise too fast and want extra challenge, you
        can practice CSS: add some fancy effects, such as shadows, hover
        effects,
        <a href="https://thinkux.ca/blog/Creating-Framed-Matted-Pictures-Using-CSS/">a
            picture
            frame</a>,
        or even a <a href="https://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/PbBwjp">very
            fancy frame</a>.
    </p>


    <h2>Template</h2>
    <p>Start with this file as a template. It should be enough by creating only
        the CSS style, the HTML elements are in place already.</p>
    <h3>The gallery</h3>
    <div id="gallery-container">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=1"
             alt="Random picture">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=2"
             alt="Random picture">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=3"
             alt="Random picture">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=4"
             alt="Random picture">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/300?random_index=5"
             alt="Random picture">
    </div>
