<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This is a bonus exercise for especially curious and active students :).</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>If you are done and have some time left, use the time creatively! For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Display a <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/creating-dice-in-flexbox-in-css-a02a5d85e516">real
        dice</a> instead of a number.
    </li>
    <li>Allow the user to throw multiple dice at once (Yes
        <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/dice-die/">both "die" and "dice" are legit singular forms of the
            word</a>). Several ways to do it. One of them: if you send an HTTP POST (instead of a GET) and specify
        n=X (where X is the number of dice you want to get, in the range 1..10) to the same API url, you will get a JSON
        array back with X dice values, instead of a single value.
    </li>
    <li>Explore other options for sending Ajax requests, for example, the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch API.</a></li>
</ul>
