    <h1>Exercise 10.6</h1>
    <p>This is Exercise 10.6, lecture on traversing DOM with Javascript, used in the course
        <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2301">IDATA2301 Web technologies</a>
        at NTNU, campus Aalesund.
    </p>
    <p>Go <a href="../..">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the exercise is to learn how you can select more than one element</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Part 1 - inspect an existing site in the console</h3>

    <p>Go to <a href="https://web-tek.ninja">https://web-tek.ninja</a> in your browser (preferably in another tab), open
        developer tool console and explore the DOM:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select all <code>h2</code> elements on the site: type <code>document.querySelectorAll('h2')</code> in the
            console, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Explore the NodeList you get in return. Open it. What happens when you move
            the mouse over the first element in the array?
        </li>
        <li>Select all elements with class <code>css-exercise</code>. You should get all 6 <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
            elements containing links to CSS exercises. But you probably got only 5 items, right. Can you find what is
            missing? P.S. Debugging and finding mistakes in HTML, CSS and Javascript is an essential skill!
        </li>
        <li>Select the first <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element on the page, store it in a variable.</li>
        <li>Now use that variable to find all <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> elements inside that article. How many did you
            get? What do they refer to?
        </li>
    </ol>
