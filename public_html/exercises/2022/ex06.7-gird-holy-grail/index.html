    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the exercise is to practice using grid in realistic layouts.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)">Holy grail</a>
        is a classic layout, many web pages use some form of it.
        Here is an example of a holy grail layout:
    </p>
    <img src="img/holy-grail-example.jpg" class="reference-img" alt="Holy grail layout example"/>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Take the <strong>Holy Grail layout</strong> you created with Flexbox (exercise 6.6), and <strong>re-create it
        using CSS Grid.</strong> You may need to do some HTML changes as well (Hint: all the areas must be direct child
        of grid, including nav, main and ads).
    </p>
