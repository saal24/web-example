    <h1>Exercise 10.9</h1>
    <p>This is Exercise 10.9, lecture on modifying DOM with Javascript, used in the course
        <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2301">IDATA2301 Web technologies</a>
        at NTNU, campus Aalesund.
    </p>
    <p>Go <a href="../../index.html">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the exercise is to learn how you can access and modify some properties of DOM
        elements.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Find out, how you can <i>catch</i> the event of user picking a value in selectbox, and how you can read the
            value.
        </li>
        <li>Create a page with a text "Pick your favorite color", and a selectbox with values ["Red", "Green"
            "Roundhouse kick"].
        <li>Add a text which says: "I see that your favorite color is …". Hint it is probably a good idea to create a
            paragraph for the whole sentence and include a span for the placeholder of the color. Something along these
            lines:
            <code>&lt;p&gt;I see that your favorite color is&lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>. You probably
            also want an ID for the span to get a reference to it in Javascript.
        </li>
        <li>Add Javascript which reacts on user picking a color and replaces the "…" with the name of the chosen color.
        </li>
        <li>Extend the solution of the previous exercise, add some more colors to the selectbox.
        </li>
        <li>Add a div of a certain size (for example, 220x150 pixels), set <code>id="color-example"</code> for it.
        </li>
        <li>Whenever the user picks a color in the selectbox, set the background color of that div to the chosen color.
            Hint: you probably want to define color codes (such as <code>#ff0000</code>) as values for the selecbox
            options, in addition to the values displayed for the user. An example:
            <code>&lt;option value="#ff0000"&gt;Red&lt;/option&gt;</code>.
            You will also need to modify the code displaying the user-friendly value of the color. Find out on the net
            how you can access the index of selected item for a selectbox, and then text of the selected option.
        </li>
        <li>Extra challenge: when "Roundhouse kick" is selected, set background image of the div with
            <code>id="color-example"</code> to a picture of <i>you know whom.</i>
        </li>
    </ol>
